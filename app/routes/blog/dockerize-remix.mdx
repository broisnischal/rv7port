#### Effortlessly Dockerize Your Remix App with Bun

[Remix](https://remix.run) redefines full-stack development with its innovative
server and browser runtime. By leveraging server-side rendering, lightning-fast
page loads, and seamless transitions, Remix gives you powerful performance out
of the box.

In this post, I'll walk you through how to easily dockerize your Remix app using
[Bun](https://bun.sh) and get it ready for deployment in no time.

### Step 1: Crafting Your Dockerfile

Dockerizing your Remix app starts by defining a **Dockerfile**. Here's how you
can spin up your Remix app in a docker container.

```dockerfile
# /Dockerfile

# Use Bun's lightweight image as the base
FROM oven/bun as base
WORKDIR /app
ENV NODE_ENV="production"

# Build stage
FROM base as build
RUN apt-get update -qq && \
    apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config python-is-python3

# Install dependencies
COPY --link package.json ./
RUN bun install --ci

# Build the Remix app
RUN bun run build

# Final stage
COPY --link . .
FROM base
COPY --from=build /app /app

# Expose the port and start the app
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["bun", "run", "start"]
```

Pro tip: Bunâ€™s performance is unmatched in this context, making it a great
choice to boost build times and speed up your app.

#### Step 2: Fine-Tuning with .dockerignore

Make sure your image stays lean by ignoring unnecessary files during the build
process with a .dockerignore file:

```sh
# .dockerignore

node_modules
npm-debug.log
```

#### Step 3: Build, Run, and Push

With your Dockerfile and .dockerignore in place, youâ€™re now ready to build and
run the container:

```sh
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t nischal/bun-app .

# Run the app on port 3000
docker run -p 3000:3000 nischal/bun-app

```

Once your app is running smoothly, push it to Docker Hub:

```sh
docker login
docker push nischal/bun-app
```

With these steps, you've dockerized your Remix app in style, combining the
blazing speed of Bun with the flexibility of Docker. Ready to take it further?
This setup is perfect for deployment on any cloud platform. ðŸš€
